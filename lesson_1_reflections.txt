Если мы находим различия - они могли повлечь ошибку. Можно находить именно слово, на которое различаются версии, а потом уже выдавать, в которой строке 

?How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I won't spend lot of time to restore my files and I'll have an opportunity to compare versions so I'll be able to get the best version quickly.

?What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The automatically committed can lose the important change at important moment. Moreover, it is hard to remember what had changed just by time mark.

?Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It depends on purpose, I guess. If we have a logical relation between several files so it's important. Programmer's work often require it.

?How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log let you look at commits while git diff show you comparing between some versions of fileю

?
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

because of the opportiunity to return to the "right version" quicly, but i'm not sure i understand the question right

?Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for problem set, of course
